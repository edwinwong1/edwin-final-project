                Being defined as an American yourself comes from many different aspects. You can represent any nationality, gender, or role in society. They are all essential to the importance of becoming Americanized. Doesn’t matter if you’re from a different ethnic group, religious group, or cultural group because America has been a prosperous country phrased as a “free country” providing numerous amounts of opportunities to live with. You don’t necessarily have to integrate into American culture/value to be defined as one.

            <p class="yourself-response">
                First off, your nationality represents a big part of who you are as an American. America is known for its diversity of culture/values. We have different varieties of food that represent different cultures from different countries. We also have a variety of locations that respect certain cultures. The idea of racial equality has been implemented in our history book long ago. Accepting your nationality and everybody’s nationality is one of the essential steps in being an American.

                In addition, respecting people’s beliefs and opinions is another essential aspect. Following the constitutional amendments and appreciating the current system we have keeps the country orderly fashion. With the Constitution always in act and freedom granted, we can still represent American as a great country and be looked upon as great citizens.                                                                                                         Overall, to be defined as an American is to acknowledge American values because our values represent who we are no matter where we’re from.
