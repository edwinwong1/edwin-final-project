Think about the answers that you received from your interview subject, your historical figure, and yourself. Think about the similarities and differences you hear in each response. Do you see any historical patterns? Do you see any change that has taken place over time?
                </h5>
                <p class="main-response">
I noticed different responses between the historical figure and my interview subject. Usually, people who immigrate are the ones who struggle to seek a better living standard because they are experiencing hardship in their own country and that was exactly what Sergey Brin was. Sergey had to deal with multiple pull factors against his religion pressuring him to escape Russia because he was facing Jewish persecution. On the Other hand, David Fan was the complete opposite as he was quite successful in Taiwan living in a costly house before immigrating here wealthy and prepared. I also noticed some notable changes in the immigration process over time, as immigrating into America during the 1990s was a lot easier than in the 1970s. Sergey Brin had to wait 8 months for his immigration visa to be approved in 1978 while David Fan’s immigration process wasn’t as extensive. This can exemplify the changes that have been implemented over time in order to make immigration easier since the beginning of American immigration history.

                <p class="main-response">
                    Sergey Brin’s perspective on the representation of an American is very simplistic. His family chose to immigrate to America even though there was an ongoing Cold War. He was Americanized at a very young age as he lived in a household consisting of a mathematician and scientist and received his American citizenship at a very young age when he arrived. Brin valued America as a special country that gave him the opportunity to restart his life into a thriving healthy life. Through his knowledge, he and Larry created Google, a database search engine that will change America forever. Google contributed a lot to today’s society as it’s still the most popular search engine providing quality information for everyone.

                <p class="main-response">
                    David Fan saw America in a similar way. During the interview, he perceived America as a great country filled with opportunities. He respects their culture/values. He started off by learning English first, a great entrance in becoming part of America is learning their most spoken language. He talked about his job as an architect from Taiwan, he taught other architects about Taiwanese architecture bringing in new types of architecture. He also really appreciated America’s government and participated in the election. As an American citizen, he made his vote for his favorable president. Like Biden says, “every vote counts”. Just like any other immigrant, he involved himself in American culture and contributed to America.

                    Lastly, in order to be an American, I believe we need to involve ourselves in this society. Use your quality ideas to bring in new innovations. Accept everybody for who they are and what they are. Assimilate the values of America and appreciate the laws implemented to protect our rights. It doesn’t matter what nationality you are, as long as you are a citizen, you’re an American.
