Think about the answers that you received from your interview subject, your historical figure, and yourself. Think about the similarities and differences you hear in each response. Do you see any historical patterns? Do you see any change that has taken place over time?

I noticed different responses between the historical figure and my interview subject. Usually, people who immigrate are the ones who struggle to seek a better living standard because they are experiencing hardship in their own country and that was exactly what Sergey Brin was. Sergey had to deal with multiple pull factors against his religion pressuring him to escape Russia because he was facing Jewish persecution. On the Other hand, David Fan was the complete opposite as he was quite successful in Taiwan living in a costly house before immigrating here wealthy and prepared. I also noticed some notable changes in the immigration process over time, as immigrating into America during the 1990s was a lot easier than in the 1970s. Sergey Brin had to wait 8 months for his immigration visa to be approved in 1978 while David Fan’s immigration process wasn’t as extensive. This can exemplify the changes that have been implemented over time in order to make immigration easier since the beginning of American immigration history.
