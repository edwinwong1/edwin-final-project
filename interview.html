            <h4 class="interview__background-info">David Fan is my interviewee who is currently 50, born in Taipei, Taiwan. He immigrated in 1995 at the age of 22 and is currently residing in Arcadia, California with his family.

            <h4 class="interview__question">
                1. Who did you leave behind? Why and how did you feel? Did they support you?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I want to find out if their relations from their home country supported them in any way and if they felt
                like they made the right decision.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> I left some of my relatives and friends in Taiwan and felt like it was the right decision as
                America brought in a new experience for me to see. My parents supported me. They are also in America and
                they immigrated before I did.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                2. How was the process of immigrating to America? How long did it take? Was it challenging?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I want to know their experience through the whole immigration process because it is important to
                understand the struggles they went through to get here like Ellis island.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> If I remember, the process was pretty easy since my parents already immigrated here. No, it
                was not challenging.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                3. How did your culture differ from the culture in America? Did you assimilate into American culture?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I chose this question because my interviewee may have a different perspective on American culture
                whether they found any differences between the two cultures.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> The culture in Taiwan is different in America because over in Taiwan, people are Buddhism and
                they speak Mandarin as their language. They are also very friendly and Taiwan has one of the wealthiest
                economy probably in Asia. It was pretty crowded too since Taiwan’s a lot smaller than America. Yes, I
                did adopt American culture. I enjoy the freedom a lot more because US made me feel more “free”. My
                mother and father also live here so it was fine to adopt American cultures they like it.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                4. Did any American values or culture feel interesting to you or did you feel detached from it?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                Similar to question #3, I chose this question because they may agreements or disagreements about certain
                American values/culture that may affect their life. Maybe they felt accepted or neglected by America.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> I think American values/culture felt interesting to me. I experience the different holidays
                America has. I tried different cultures of food here and I really liked it. I could also meet new people
                that are not only Taiwanese and they were really friendly.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                5. Do you identify yourself as a patriotic or nationalist in America?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I chose this question because America is currently #1 in the World power ranking and maybe this will
                affect their perspective for their country and other countries. If they feel like they’re loyal to
                America and don’t care for other countries or they’re superior to other countries.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span>I don't think I'm either one. I love both Taiwan and America and support both equally.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                6. Do you find living in America or in your own country a lot more preferable? Why?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I want to figure out if their decision in immigrating to America made their life enjoyable or if their
                own country is more suitable for them.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> I prefer to live in America because I enjoy the beauty and nature compared to Taiwan because
                in Taiwan, it’s rainier and foggier. I can enjoy working on my garden here because the weather is nice
                so my plants don't get overwatered.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                7. Are you relatively interested in politics? If so, What is your opinion on our current system in
                America compared to Taiwan?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I chose this question because many people have their own political opinion on the current
                situations/affairs going on around the world like how people disagree with China’s government
                system/ccp.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> Yes, politics, Iam pretty interested in politics in both Taiwan and America. I watch the news
                sometimes to stay updated and I also voted this year. My opinion is that the American government is
                better. I think because I have more freedom and rights compared to Taiwan but I think Taiwan’s
                government is still good enough.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                8. Have you ever experienced any discrimination based on your nationality, race, beliefs, and political
                opinion?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                This question is important because many immigrants have been suppressed because of their nationality and
                I want to know if they have in any way experienced any disruptions in America.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> I have seen some problems on our nationality like this year because of the coronavirus on the
                news a lot. To be honest, I hardly experience any discrimination because I live around a safe city and
                Arcadia have a lot of asains just like me but I have experienced discrimination for my belief in
                buddhism because I think America is mostly Christian.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                9. Have you ever regret your decision in immigrating to America?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                This question is important because America is known as a country prospering globally, providing benefits
                and opportunities to many citizens. I want to know if they regret their decision in coming here or they
                did have a successful transition here.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> No, I am satisfied in America and I think America is better than Taiwan as the weather and
                environment is much better and I feel more space because it’s less busy/crowded here.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="interview__question-container">
            <h4 class="interview__question">
                10. Have you ever considered yourself a citizen of the United States?

            </h4>
            <p class="interview__purpose">
                I chose this question because I wanted to know if they identify themselves as an “American” who
                Americanized. If they have adapted to the current society.

            </p>
            <p class="interview__response">
                <span class="bold">Response: </span> Yes, I consider myself a citizen of the United States. I really enjoy the country and
                environment. I learned english and learning english was a fun experience because learning a new language
                is always hard. I feel like I have Americanized into the current society.
